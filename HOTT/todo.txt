Try augmenting Id′-AP and Id′-AP≡ by explicit functions that "coerce" along them, and heterogeneous equalities for these "coercions".  These should all be computed type-wise in the same way, making for more boilerplate.  (Also the Id′-AP≡ coercions should reduce over refls to the Id′-AP ones, just as the equalities do.)  But the potential advantage would be that we can also assert by a rewrite that these coercions are definitionally inverse.
