top-pop-pop-REFL should be provable.

Can Id′-AP≡ make the endpoints of the equality of base identifications implicit?

If we ever have to remove the rewrite rules for AP₀ and AP₁, then the version of Id′-AP that's postulated and computes should involve heterogeneous equalities in the endpoints.  Otherwise, the computation rules would involve commuting constructors past coercions along AP₀ and AP₁.  I'm not sure whether this should be literally the current Id′-AP≡, or leave off the equality of base identifications.  Making such a change shouldn't be too invasive, since in either case Id′-AP is the special case of Id′-AP≡ with all refls (only the direction of that equality would change).  This is the same reason that ap-AP is already heterogeneous.
