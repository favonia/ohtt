Move Sq≡ to Square.agda.  We aren't using it, but it shouldn't do any harm to have.

top-pop-pop-REFL should be provable.

Can Id′-AP≡ make the endpoints of the equality of base identifications implicit?

If we ever have to remove the rewrite rules for AP₀ and AP₁, then the version of Id′-AP that's postulated and computes should involve heterogeneous equalities in the endpoints.  Otherwise, the computation rules would involve commuting constructors past coercions along AP₀ and AP₁.  I'm not sure whether this should be literally the current Id′-AP≡, or leave off the equality of base identifications.  Making such a change shouldn't be too invasive, since in either case Id′-AP is the special case of Id′-AP≡ with all refls (only the direction of that equality would change).

Even now, I think ap-AP should postulate a heterogeneous equality, for the same reasons.

The fact that AP only reduces on ∷, together with eta-contraction for ∷, breaks confluence and subject reduction in the presence of variable functions between telescopes.  Given a variable f : el Γ → el (Δ ▸ A), the term AP (λ x → pop (f x) ∷ top (f x)) γ reduces incompatibly AP-∷ and also by η∷.  But for only concrete telescopes and their elements, I hope it's okay.

Note that top-pop-pop-AP etc. are actually reflʰ, so the coercion in ap-top actually immediately reduces.  But we can't just write that to start with, because reflʰ only becomes well-typed after eta-expanding ∷ inside a λ to make the AP reduce.  I think this is a violation of subject reduction.
