- Universe stuff
- sum types
- natural numbers
- ap-naturality for sym (two kinds?)
- braid equation
- why does Pi.Transport.Lift make Pi.Transport.Ulift slow?
- why does Pi.Transport make Arrow.Transport slow?

- Is it possible to predeclare all notations with their fixities and precedences in a central location, as with Coq's "Reserved Notation"?  That would make it easier to get all the relative precedences right.
