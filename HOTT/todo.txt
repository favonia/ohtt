- why does Pi.Transport make Arrow.Transport slow?

- Is it possible to predeclare all notations with their fixities and precedences in a central location, as with Coq's "Reserved Notation"?  That would make it easier to get all the relative precedences right.  I don't think so, but let's make it easier for ourselves by putting all fixity declarations in each file at the very top, and taking a moment to uniformize them.

- Would removing Id-AP-refláµ‰ improve the situation in Sum any?
